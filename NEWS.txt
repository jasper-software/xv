5.0.0 (2024-02-06)
==================

* Removed all of the obsolete (and no longer used) make/imake-based build
  infrastructure.
* Removed the local copies of the source code for the external libraries
  used for JPEG and TIFF support, as these local copies do not receive
  bug fixes and are therefore very likely to have many serious security
  vulnerabilities.  Since the CMake-based build process already uses
  whatever JPEG and TIFF libraries are installed on the system, these
  local copies of external libraries are completely unnecessary.

4.2.0 (2023-07-16)
==================

* Fixed the splash screen to display the correct version number.

4.1.1 (2023-05-27)
==================

* Fixed a build problem on MacOS.

4.1.0 (2023-05-27)
==================

* Added support for webp format.

4.0.0 (2022-02-16)
==================

* Applied jumbo patch set and numerous other patches including those from the
  Fedora Linux RPM for the XV software.
* Applied several patches for the XV software from OpenBSD.
* Applied several patches for the XV software from OpenSUSE.
* Added support for CMake-based builds.
* Added a GitHub Actions CI framework for performing test builds on each
  repository push.
* Added a GitHub Actions workflow for generating release tarballs on each
  repository tag corresponding to a release.
* Added support for JasPer 3.0.0.
