6.0.2 (2024-10-15)
==================

* Added -isize option to control the icon size in the browser.
  The syntax is -isize <width> or -isize <width>x<height>
  If the height is omitted, it defaults to the width * 3/4.

* xv now checks the XV_OPTIONS environment variable before reading the
  command line. xv splits it into words and parses it like command line
  options. Use XV_OPTIONS to set default options.

6.0.1 (2024-09-01)
==================

* xvjpeg.c,xvpng.c: Fix gcc warnings on -Wclobbered.

* Fix xvtext.c overwrite exposed by the link-time optimization fix.

6.0.0 (2024-08-12)
==================

* Add basic HiDPI support.
* Improve the compatibility of the source code with more modern C standards
  (e.g., C23).

    24-bit autocrop bug partial fix (applied to all four places).
* Increased some buffers to fix compile warnings and sanitizer warnings.
* Fixed unused variable warnings with XV_UNUSED macro or by removing the variables.
* Updated prototypes in xv.h to fix warnings about declarations without prototypes.
* Added a -c option to the build script to do a clean build.
* Added .gitignore
* Fixes for G3, tiff, and wbmp processing.
* Fixed memory leak of tv->lines in computeText() in xvtext.c.
* Fixed possible overwrite in add_filelist_to_namelist() in xv.c.
* Added overprint.ps sample PS image.
* Switched order of calloc() args to fix compile warning in xvbrowse.c.
* Fixed crash on long file names in xv.c.
* Added Add a test image with a long file name in data/images.
* Rebuilt with clang and fixed compile warnings.
* Added HiDPI support.
    New options -dpimult # to set the scale factor,
    -hidpi to set a scale factor of 2,
    +hidpi to set a scale factor of 1.
    Most dialogs scale based on the dpi multiplier.
    xv automatically defaults to -hidpi for displays with more than 144 dpi.
* Fixed error from negative shift in xvpic.c.
* Fixed crash on NULL monofsetinfo in xv.c.
* Fixed bad pointer reference in last interation of LoadCurrentDirectory in xvdir.c.
* Fixed loop limit in CharsetDelWin to avoid accessing csinfo out of bounds if there are no text windows in xvtext.c.
* Convert function definitions to use prototypes as required by C23.
* Add support for xz compressed files.
* Fixed opening archives and compressed files with special characters in their name.
* Fixed opening compressed archives.

5.0.0 (2024-02-06)
==================

* Removed all of the obsolete (and no longer used) make/imake-based build
  infrastructure.
* Removed the local copies of the source code for the external libraries
  used for JPEG and TIFF support, as these local copies do not receive
  bug fixes and are therefore very likely to have many serious security
  vulnerabilities.  Since the CMake-based build process already uses
  whatever JPEG and TIFF libraries are installed on the system, these
  local copies of external libraries are completely unnecessary.

4.2.0 (2023-07-16)
==================

* Fixed the splash screen to display the correct version number.

4.1.1 (2023-05-27)
==================

* Applied jumbo patch set and numerous other patches including those from the
  Fedora Linux RPM for the XV software.
* Applied several patches for the XV software from OpenBSD.
* Applied several patches for the XV software from OpenSUSE.
* Added support for CMake-based builds.
* Added a GitHub Actions CI framework for performing test builds on each
  repository push.
* Added a GitHub Actions workflow for generating release tarballs on each
  repository tag corresponding to a release.
* Added support for JasPer 3.0.0.
