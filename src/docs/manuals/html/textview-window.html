<h1>The TextView Window</h1>

<p><a name="text-view-window"><img src="images/fig-164.gif"

<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p><i>xv</i> now has the ability to display arbitrary text data.
While there are several different ways to cause a <i>TextView</i>
window to appear, (such as opening an unrecognized type of file,
using the <b>Text view</b> command in the <i>Visual Schnauzer</i>,
or the <b>TextView</b>, <b>Comments</b>, or <b>License</b>
commands in the <i>xv controls</i> window) all of the windows
behave the same.</p>

<p>The TextView window has two primary modes of operation. It can
display data as ASCII text, or it can display data in hexadecimal
format.</p>

<p>There are a total of two TextView windows available. One is
reserved for the <b>Comments</b> command. The other is used for
all other text data.</p>

<p>As you might suspect, you can scroll the TextView windows by
using the mouse in the scroll bars (as described in &quot;<a
href="control-window-6.html#operating-list-window">Operating a
List Window</a>&quot;). Likewise, you can scroll the window
around using the arrow keys on your keyboard, the <b>&lt;PageUp&gt;</b>
and <b>&lt;PageDown&gt;</b> keys (sometimes labeled <b>&lt;Prev&gt;</b>
and <b>&lt;Next&gt;</b> ) and the <b>&lt;Home&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;End&gt;</b>
keys. It behaves as you would expect.</p>

<p>You can switch modes by pressing the nice friendly <b>Ascii</b>
and <b>Hex</b> buttons. <b>Close</b> (or pressing <b>&lt;Esc&gt;</b>)
will close the TextView window.</p>

<h3><a name="ascii-mode">ASCII Mode</a></h3>

<p>This is the default mode for the TextView windows. It will
display text of any width and length. The only limitation is that
all of the text must fit into memory. If it doesn't, you'll get
an appropriate error message, and the text will not be displayed.</p>

<p>TextView windows are resizable. When you change the size of
the main window, the inner text display window will change size
appropriately, and display more (or less) data. While the default
size of all TextView windows (except for the <b>Comments</b>
window) is 80 characters wide by 24 lines high, there is nothing
magical about these numbers. They're only chosen out of a sense
of tradition.</p>

<p>When in ASCII mode, the TAB character (ctrl-I) and the NL
character (ctrl-J) are interpreted as is normal on a UNIX system
(e.g. tab stops every 8 characters, NL marks end of line). The CR
character (ctrl-M) is not displayed.</p>

<p>All other control characters (characters with an ASCII value
less than '32') are displayed with a caret (^) and the
appropriate upper-case letter. For example, character number 17
(decimal) will be displayed as '^Q'.</p>

<p>All characters with an ASCII value greater than 127 are
displayed as octal numbers with a leading backslash. As an
example, character number 128 (decimal) will display as '\'.</p>

<p>All other characters are displayed with the appropriate
standard glyph.</p>

<h3><a name="hex-mode">Hex Mode<br>
</a><img src="images/fig-165.gif" width="612" height="230"></h3>

<p>This mode is useful for displaying binary data. In fact, if
you have some binary data to display, you might want to start up <i>xv</i>
just to display it, as this mode beats the heck out of using the
standard UNIX command '<tt>od -ha</tt>'.</p>

<p>The data is shown 16 bytes to a line. The first number on each
line is the offset (in hex) from the beginning of the file. This
is followed by 16 bytes, shown in hex, and then in ASCII. Bytes
which have a value less than 0x20 or greater than 0x7f are shown
as a '.' in the ASCII section.</p>

<p>While you can resize the window while in <b>Hex</b> mode,
changing the width will not be of any use, as the output is
formatted for an 80 character wide TextView window. Making the
window wider will just put unused space on the right side. Making
the window narrower will just enable the horizontal scroll bar.
Changing the height of the window may prove useful, however.</p>

<h2><a name="comment-window">The Comment Window</a></h2>

<p>The <i>xv comments</i> window (opened by the <b>Comments</b>
command in the <i>xv controls</i> window) operates in exactly the
same way as the TextView window. You can even display image
comments in <b>Hex</b> mode, though that doesn't sound all that
useful.</p>

<p>The <i>xv comments</i> window displays any comments found in
the currently-loaded image file. If there are no comments, the
window will be empty. Note that only certain image formats
support comment fields (GIF89, JPEG, TIFF, and PBM/PGM/PPM are
the most likely formats to have comments).</p>

<p>Whenever a new image is loaded, the <i>xv comments</i> window
is updated to reflect the new image comments, or lack thereof.</p>

<p>Whenever you save an image in a format that supports comments,
the comments from the last loaded image will be written out as
well. This lets you read a file (say a GIF) which has comments,
and write it out in another format (say, JPEG) preserving the
comments.</p>

<p>Currently, <i>xv</i> does <i>not</i> give you a way to
directly edit the image comments. Given how few images actually
have comments in them, it seemed like a lot of work for very
little gain. (Yeah, I know, if something actually let you edit
the comments, perhaps people would start entering some...)
Whatever. Seems likely enough that this feature will make it into
a future version of <i>xv</i>. Of course, that's exactly what I
said in the 3.00 documentation, a year and a half ago, so you may
want to take that statement with a grain of salt...</p>

<p>Until then, if you <i>really</i> want to add or edit the
comments in an image file, write it out as a PBM/PGM/PPM file.
This format has a plain-text header (comments simply begin with a
'#' character, which is not part of the comment), and you can
edit it very easily with <i>emacs</i>, or any other reasonable
text editor. Once that's done, you can use <i>xv</i> to convert
the file back into the desired format.</p>
