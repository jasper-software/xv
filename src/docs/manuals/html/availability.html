<p>Thank you for acquiring a copy of <i>xv</i>, a pretty nifty X
program. I hope you enjoy using it, as I've enjoyed writing it.</p>

<p>The latest version of <i>xv</i> is available on the web at 
<a href="https://xv.trilon.com">https://xv.trilon.com</a> and 
via anonymous <a name="ftp-site">ftp</a> at 
<a href="ftp://ftp.trilon.com/pub/xv/">ftp://ftp.trilon.com/pub/xv/</a>.

If you're not sure if you have the latest version, or you are
missing the source or documentation for <i>xv</i>, please pick up
the latest version of the <em>xv</em> distribution. </p>

<h2><a name="licensing-information"><i>xv</i> Licensing
Information</a></h2>

<p><em><strong>xv</strong></em> <b>is shareware for personal use
only.</b></p>

<p>You may use <i>xv</i> for your own amusement, and if you find
it nifty, useful, generally cool, or of some value to you, your
registration fee would be greatly appreciated. $25 is the
standard registration fee, though of course, larger amounts are
quite welcome. Folks who donate $40 or more can receive a
printed, bound copy of the <i>xv</i> manual for no extra charge.
If you want one, just ask. <i>Be sure to specify the version of
xv that you are using!</i></p>

<p><b>Commercial, government, and institutional users </b><strong>must</strong>
<b>register their copies of </b><em><strong>xv</strong></em><b>.</b></p>

<p>This does <i>not</i> mean that you are required to register <i>xv</i>
just because you play with it on the workstation in your office.
That falls under the heading of 'personal use'. If you are a
systems administrator, you can put <i>xv</i> up in a public
directory for your users' amusement. Again, 'personal use',
albeit plural.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you use <i>xv</i> in the course of doing
your work, whatever your 'work' may happen to be, you <i>must</i>
register your copy of <i>xv</i> . (Note: If you are a student,
and you use <i>xv</i> to do classwork or research, you should get
your professor/teacher/advisor to purchase an appropriate number
of copies.)</p>

<p><i>xv</i> licenses are $25 each. You should purchase one
license per workstation, or one per <i>xv</i> user, whichever is
the smaller number. <i>xv</i> is <i>not</i> sold on a 'number of
concurrent users' basis. If <i>xv</i> was some $1000 program,
yes, that would be a reasonable request, but at $25, it's not.
Also, given that <i>xv</i> is completely unlocked, there is no
way to enforce any 'number of concurrent users' limits, so it
isn't sold that way.</p>

<p>Printed and bound copies of the 130-ish page <i>xv</i> manual
are available for $15 each. Note that manuals are <i>only</i>
sold with, at minimum, an equal number of licenses. (e.g. if you
purchase 5 licenses, you can also purchase <i>up to</i> 5 copies
of the manual)</p>

<p>The source code to the program can be had (as a compressed
'tar' file split over a couple 3.5&quot; MS-DOS formatted
floppies) for $15, for those who don't have ftp capabilities.</p>

<p>Orders outside the US and Canada must add an additional $5 per
manual ordered to cover the additional shipping charges.</p>

<p>Checks, money orders, and purchase orders are accepted. Credit
cards are not. All forms of payment must be payable in US Funds.
Checks must be payable through a US bank (or a US branch of a
non-US bank). Purchase orders for less than $50, while still
accepted, are not encouraged.</p>

<p>All payments should be payable to 'John Bradley', and mailed
to:</p>

<p>John Bradley<br>
1053 Floyd Terrace<br>
Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA</p>

<h3>Site Licenses</h3>

<p>If you are planning to purchase 10 or more licenses, site
licenses are available, at a substantial discount. Site licenses
let you run <i>xv</i> on any and all computing equipment at the
site, for any purpose whatsoever. The site license covers the
current version of <i>xv</i>, and any versions released within
one year of the licensing date. You are also allowed to duplicate
and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the <i>xv</i>
manual, but only for use within the site. Covered versions of the
software may be run in perpetuity.</p>

<p>Also, it should be noted that a 'site' can be defined as
anything you'd like. It can be a physical location (a room,
building, location, etc.), an organization (a workgroup,
department, division, etc.) or any other logical grouping
(&quot;the seventeen technical writers scattered about our
company&quot;, etc.). The site license cost will be based on your
estimate of the number of <i>xv</i> users or workstations at your
site, whichever is the smaller number.</p>

<p>If you are interested in obtaining a site license, please
contact the author via electronic mail or FAX (see below for
details). Send information regarding your site (the name or
definition of the 'site', a physical address, a fax number, and
an estimate of the number of users or workstations), and we'll
get a site license out to you for your examination.</p>
