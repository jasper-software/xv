<h1>The Load Window</h1>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><a name="load-window"><img
        src="images/fig-166.gif" width="364" height="430"></a></td>
        <td valign="top">The <i>xv load</i> window lets you load
        and view images interactively, without specifying them on
        the command line when you start <i>xv</i> . While it has
        been made somewhat obsolete by the <i>Visual Schnauzer</i>,
        the <i>xv load</i> window is considerably quicker.<p>The
        load window shows the contents of the current directory
        in a scrolling window. The files will be sorted
        alphabetically, with a small icon for each indicating the
        type of file (directory, executable, or normal file).</p>
        <p>This list window operates in the same way that the one
        in the <i>xv controls</i> window works. (See &quot;<a
        href="control-window-6.html#operating-list-window">Operating
        a List Window</a>&quot; for details.) In short, you can
        operate the scroll bar, drag the highlight bar around the
        window, and use the <b>&lt;Up&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;Down&gt;</b>,
        <b>&lt;Home&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;End&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;PageUp&gt;</b>,
        and <b>&lt;PageDown&gt;</b> keys on your keyboard.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Whenever you click on a name in the list (or otherwise change
the position of the highlight bar), the name of the highlighted
file is copied to the &quot;Load file&quot; text entry region,
located below the list window. Pressing the <b>Ok</b> button (or
hitting <b>&lt;Return&gt;</b> ) will make <i>xv</i> attempt to
load the specified file. If the load attempt is successful, the
load window will disappear, and the new image will be displayed.
Otherwise, an error message will be displayed, and the load
window will remain visible. </p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><a name="browse"><img
        src="images/fig-167.gif" width="64" height="17"></a></td>
        <td valign="top">The <b>Browse</b> checkbox overrides
        this behavior, and keeps the load window visible until
        explicitly closed (via the <b>Cancel</b> button). This is
        handy if you're using <i>xv</i> to 'wander around a
        directory tree', and plan to be using the <b>Load</b>
        command quite often. (Though a better way would probably
        involve using the <b>Visual Schnauzer</b>.)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>If the image is successfully loaded, its name will be added to
the <i>xv controls</i> window list. This will let you quickly
reload it later without have to go through the <i>xv load</i>
window again.</p>

<p>You can also load a file by double-clicking on its name in the
file list.</p>

<p>If the specified filename begins with a '!' or '|' character,
the filename will be interpreted as a shell command to run. The
leading '!' or '|' is dropped, and the rest of the line is fed to
the default system shell. The command is expected to generate an
image in one of the <i>xv</i> -recognized formats as its standard
output. If the command returns non-zero, <i>xv</i> assumes it
failed, and doesn't try to read the output produced. You can pipe
multiple commands together. For example loading &quot;<tt>! xwd |
xwdtopnm</tt>&quot; would run <i>xwd</i> to generate a window
dump, pipe that to <i>xwdtopnm</i> to convert it to a PPM file,
and that file would be piped to <i>xv</i>. Which, as examples go,
made a lot more sense back before <em>xv</em> was able to read
XWD files directly.</p>

<p>If the specified file is a directory, <i>xv</i> will figure
that out and (instead of loading it) will <i>cd</i> to that
directory, and display its contents in the list window.</p>

<p>Above the list window is a pop-up menu button. It normally
displays the name of the current directory. If you click this
button, and hold the mouse down, the complete path will be shown,
one directory per line. You can go 'up' the directory tree any
number of levels, all the way up to the root directory, by simply
selecting a directory name in this list.</p>

<p>For those who prefer the direct approach, you can simply type
file or directory names in the &quot;Load file&quot; text entry
region. If you type a directory name and hit <b>&lt;Return&gt;</b>,
<i>xv</i> will <i>cd</i> to that directory and display its
contents in the list window. If you type a file name and hit <b>&lt;Return&gt;</b>,
<i>xv</i> will attempt to load the file. You can enter relative
paths (relative to the currently displayed directory), absolute
paths, and even paths that begin with a '~'.</p>

<p><a name="text-editing-keys">The</a> &quot;Load file&quot; text
entry region supports a number of <i>emacs</i>-like editing keys:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt><b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; f</b> </dt>
    <dd>moves the cursor forward one character </dd>
    <dt><b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; b</b></dt>
    <dd>moves the cursor backward one character</dd>
    <dt><b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; a</b></dt>
    <dd>moves the cursor to the beginning of the line</dd>
    <dt><b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; e</b></dt>
    <dd>moves the cursor to the end of the line</dd>
    <dt><b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; d</b></dt>
    <dd>deletes the character to the right of the cursor</dd>
    <dt><b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; u</b></dt>
    <dd>clears the entire line</dd>
    <dt><b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; k</b></dt>
    <dd>clears from the cursor position to the end of the line.</dd>
    <dt><b>&lt;Tab&gt;</b></dt>
    <dd>Filename completion. Note: it can only complete 'simple'
        filenames (no '/' chars)</dd>
</dl>

<p>If the filename is so long that it cannot be completely
displayed in the text entry region, a thick line will appear on
the left or right side (or both sides) of the region to show that
&quot;there's more over this way&quot;. </p>

<dl>
    <dt><img src="images/fig-168.gif" width="81" height="25"></dt>
    <dd>Pressing the <b>Rescan</b> button will rescan the current
        directory. While the contents of the current directory
        are read each time the load window is opened, it is
        perfectly possible (given a multitasking operating
        system) that some other program may add, delete, or
        rename files in the current directory. <i>xv</i> would
        not know if this happened. The <b>Rescan</b> button gives
        you an easy way of 'kicking' <i>xv</i> into looking
        again. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><img src="images/fig-169.gif" width="81" height="25"></dt>
    <dd>The <b>Load All</b> button simply copies the names of all
        'plain files' found in the current directory into the <i>xv
        controls</i> filename list, where you have the <b>Next</b>
        and <b>Prev</b> buttons to help you look at a list of
        files. </dd>
