    <dd>While <i>xv</i> can read both the GIF87a and GIF89a
        variants of the GIF format, it will normally write
        GIF87a. <i>xv</i> will only write a GIF89a file if there
        are image comments to be saved (comment blocks being a
        GIF89a extension).. This is in keeping with the GIF89
        specification, which states that if you don't need any of
        the features added in GIF89, you should continue to write
        GIF87, for greater compatibility with old GIF87-only
        readers. <p>Since GIF only supports one format (up to 8
        bits per pixel, with a colormap), there will be no file
        size difference between a <b>Full Color</b> and a <b>Greyscale</b>
        image. A <b>B/W Dithered</b> image, on the other hand,
        will be considerably smaller.</p>
        <p>If you are currently in <b>24-bit mode</b> , and you
        are saving in any color mode other than <b>B/W Dithered</b>
        , the currently selected 24-&gt;8 conversion algorithm
        will be used to generate an 8-bit version of the current
        image, and that image will be written. (See &quot;<a
        href="control-window-3.html#bit-menu">The 24/8 Bit Menu</a>&quot;
        for more info.) </p>

    <dt><a name="jpeg"><img src="images/fig-180.gif" width="151"
        height="16"></a></dt>
    <dd>One minor clarification: 'JPEG' is an image compression
        algorithm, <i>not</i> an image file format. 'JFIF' is a
        file format created by the fine folks at the Independent
        JPEG Group for the storage and interchange of 'JPEG'-ed
        image data. As such, it is the de-facto standard for
        'JPEG' images. So, technically, when folks talk about
        'JPEG' files, what they probably mean is 'JFIF' files,
        but it's not <i>necessarily</i> so. Therefore, it is
        possible to run across 'JPEG' files that <i>xv</i> can't
        read, because they don't adhere to the 'JFIF' file format
        standard. Just thought you'd like to know. <p><b>Full
        Color</b> images are written in a 24-bit RGB format, and <b>Greyscale</b>
        images are written in an 8-bit greyscale format. <b>B/W
        Dithered</b> images should <i>not</i> be used, as they
        will probably wind up being larger than <b>Greyscale</b>
        versions of the same images, due to the way JPEG works.
        Note: You cannot write a <b>Reduced Color</b> JPEG file.
        Trust me, given the method that JPEG uses to compress,
        it's not in your best interest to save <b>Reduced Color</b>
        JPEG files. If you attempt to do so, a <b>Full Color</b>
        JPEG file will be saved. </p>
        <p><a name="jpeg-dialog"><img src="images/fig-181.gif"
        width="414" height="230"> </a></p>
        <p>When you save in the JPEG format, the dialog box shown
        above will pop up and ask you for a quality setting and a
        smoothing value. '75%' is the default quality value, and
        really, it's a fine choice. You shouldn't have to change
        it under normal circumstances. The lower you set the
        quality, the higher the compression ratio will be (i.e.,
        the JPEG file will be smaller). Note that setting the
        quality setting to '100%' will <i>not</i> result in
        'lossless JPEG' (i.e., the original and the JPEG'd images
        will <i>not</i> be exactly the same, just very close). </p>
        <p>The smoothing value is used to 'blur' images before
        saving them. It's often a good idea to blur GIF (and
        other 8-bit color) images before saving them, as you'll
        get better compression that way, and it also may
        partially undo the dithering that been done to many 8-bit
        images. On the downside, you'll also get somewhat blurred
        images. Something you have to decide for yourself.</p>
        <p>Note: The JPEG support in <i>xv</i> is optional. While
        it is normally enabled, it is possible that it may not be
        enabled on your system (due to problems compiling the
        JPEG library, or something). If this is the case, you
        won't have a <b>JPEG</b> selection in the <b>Format</b>
        menu. Please feel free to complain to whomever built the
        binary that you're using. </p>

    <dd><b>Full Color</b> and <b>Reduced Color</b> images are
        written in a 24-bit RGB format, and <b>Greyscale</b>
        images are written in an 8-bit greyscale format. <b>B/W
        Dithered</b> images are written in a 1-bit B/W format.<p><a
        name="tiff-dialog"><img src="images/fig-183.gif"
        width="294" height="190"> </a></p>
        <p>When you save in the TIFF format, the dialog box shown
        above will pop up and ask you which type of image
        compression it should use. <b>None</b>, <b>LZW</b>, and <b>PackBits</b>
        compression types are available for use with all the
        Color modes. In addition, there are two <b>B/W Dithered</b>-only
        algorithms, <b>CCITT Group3</b> and <b>CCITT Group4</b> .
        </p>
        <p>Note: The TIFF support in <i>xv</i> is optional. While
        it is normally enabled, it is possible that it may not be
        enabled on your system (due to problems compiling the
        TIFF library, or something). If this is the case, you

    <dd><b>Full Color</b> and <b>Reduced Color</b> images are
        stored in a 24-bit RGB format, <b>Greyscale</b> images
        are stored in an 8-bit greyscale format, and <b>B/W
        Dithered</b> images are stored in a 1-bit B/W format. <p><i>xv</i>
        writes Encapsulated PostScript, so you can incorporate <i>xv</i>-generated
        PostScript into many desktop-publishing programs. <i>xv</i>
        also prepends some color-to-greyscale code, so even if
        your printer doesn't support color, you can still print
        'color' PostScript images. These images will be three
        times larger (in file size) than their greyscale
        counterparts, so it's a good idea to save <b>Greyscale</b>
        PostScript, unless you know you may be printing the file
        on a color printer at some point.</p>
        <p>Also, you should probably never need to generate <b>B/W
        Dithered</b> PostScript, as every PostScript printer I've
        ever heard of can print greyscale images. The only valid
        cases I can think of are: A) doing it for a special
        effect, and B) doing it to generate a much smaller
        (roughly 1/8th the size) PostScript file.</p>
        <p>Note: When you try to save a PostScript file, the <i>xv
        postscript</i> window will pop up to let you specify how
        you want the image printed. (See &quot;<a
        href="postscript-window.html">The PostScript Window</a>&quot;
        for details.) </p>

    <dt><a name="pbmraw"><img src="images/fig-185.gif"
        width="151" height="16"></a></dt>
    <dd><b>Full Color</b> images are saved in <b>PPM</b> format. <b>Greyscale</b>
        images are saved in <b>PGM</b> format. <b>B/W Dithered</b>
        images are saved in <b>PBM</b> format. Each of these
        formats are tailored to the data that they save, so PPM
        images are larger than PGM images, which are in turn
        larger than PBM images. <p>In the <b>raw</b> variation of
        the PBM formats, the header information is written in
        plain ASCII text, and the image data is written as binary
        data. This is the more popular of the two dialects of
        PBM, as it produces considerably smaller image files. </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><img src="images/fig-186.gif" width="151" height="16"></dt>
    <dd>Like <b>PBM/PPM (raw)</b>, only the image data is written
        as ASCII text. As such, images written in this format
        will be several times larger than images written in <b>PBM/PGM/PPM
        (raw)</b>. This is a pretty good format for interchange
        between systems because it is easy to parse. Also, since
        they are pure, printable ASCII text, images saved in this
        format can be mailed, without going through a <i>uuencode</i>-like
        program. <p>Note that <i>xv</i>-created PBM files (both <b>raw
        </b>and <b>ascii </b>variants) may break some PBM readers
        that do not correctly parse comments. If your PBM reader
        cannot parse comments, you can easily edit the PBM file
        and remove the comment lines. A comment is everything
        from a &quot;#&quot; character to the end of the line. </p>

    <dd>Saves files in the format used by the <i>bitmap</i>
        program, which is part of the standard X11 distribution.
        Since bitmap files are inherently 1-bit per pixel, you
        can only select the <b>B/W Dithered</b> option for this
        format. </dd>

    <dd>New to <i>xv </i>version 3.10, you can now load and save
        images in the XPM (X PixMap) format. Such files are best
        suited to small-ish images with a small number of colors,
        such as multi-color icons, and the like. One nifty
        feature of this format is that images can be created and
        edited using a text editor. All color choices work as
        expected. One warning: <i>xv</i> will not write out an
        XPM file with more than 256 different colors. If you are
        viewing a 24-bit image and save it as an XPM file, <i>xv</i>
        will first compute an 8-bit version of the image using
        the current 24-&gt;8 conversion algorithm (see &quot;<a
        href="control-window-3.html#bit-menu">The 24/8 Bit Menu</a>&quot;),
        and then save that. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="bmp"><img src="images/fig-189.gif" width="151"
        height="16"></a></dt>
    <dd><i>xv</i> will write a number of different types of BMP
        files depending on the 8/24 bit mode that you're in, the
        number of colors in the image, and the current 'Colors'
        choice. <p>If you are currently in <b>8-bit Mode</b>, and
        you select <b>Full Color</b>, <b>Reduced Color,</b> or <b>Greyscale</b>,
        <i>xv</i> will write out an uncompressed 4- or 8-bits per
        pixel BMP file, based on the number of different colors
        in the current image.</p>
        <p>If you are in <b>24-bit Mode</b> and you select <b>Full
        Color</b>, the program will write out an uncompressed
        24-bits per pixel image.</p>
        <p>If you are in <b>24-bit Mode</b> and you select <b>Greyscale</b>,
        an uncompressed 8-bit per pixel BMP file will be written.</p>
        <p>If you select <b>B/W Dither</b>, a 1-bit per pixel BMP
        file will be written. </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="rasterfile"><img src="images/fig-190.gif"
        width="151" height="16"></a></dt>
    <dd><b>Full Color</b> and <b>Reduced Color</b> images are
        stored in a 24-bit RGB format, <b>Greyscale</b> images
        are stored in an 8-bit greyscale format, and <b>B/W
        Dithered</b> images are stored in a 1-bit B/W format. </dd>

    <dd>If you select <b>Full Color</b> or <b>Reduced Color</b> ,
        the program will write a 24-bit image. Otherwise, it will
        write out an 8-bit image. </dd>

    <dt><a name="targa"><img src="images/fig-192.gif" width="151"

    <dd>Another new format added to <i>xv</i> version 3.10. <i>xv</i>
        can now read and write 24-bit uncompressed Targa files.
        As such files are about the only reason folks still use
        the Targa format, this shouldn't be a problem. The color
        choices will do what you'd expect, but given that <i>xv</i>
        only reads/writes 24-bit Targa files, saving anything but
        <b>Full Color</b> would be a waste. </dd>

    <dd>Note: This format is was developed at Penn, and is rarely
        seen outside of Penn. If you don't know anything about
        it, trust me, you don't want to. <p><b>Full Color</b>
        images are saved in the 3-plane, 1-band, PM_C format. <b>Greyscale</b>
        and <b>B/W Dithered</b> images are both saved in the
        1-plane, 1-band, PM_C format. As such, there is no size
        advantage to saving in the <b>B/W Dithered</b> format. </p>

    <dd>This is not an 'image file format' at all, which is why
        it appears separate from the rest of the formats in the <b>Format
        </b>menu. Instead of saving the current image, what this
        does is save a list of all the filenames in the <i>xv </i>controls
        window file list. This file list can be used in
        conjunction with the '<tt>-flist</tt>' option. See &quot;<a
