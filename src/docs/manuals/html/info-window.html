<h1><a name="info-window">The Info Window</a></h1>

<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>This window displays information about the current image,
color allocation, expansion, cropping, and any error messages. It
can be opened by issuing the <b>Image Info</b> command. (Select <b>Image
Info</b> from the <b>Windows</b> menu in the <i>xv controls</i>
window, or type <b>i</b> in any open <i>xv</i> window.) You can
close the window by using the <b>Image Info</b> command while the
window is open. You can also close the window by clicking
anywhere inside of it.</p>

<p>The top portion of the window displays the program name,
version number, and revision date. It also shows the University
of Pennsylvania shield, the PennNet logo, the copyright notice,
and of course, the author's name.</p>

<h2><a name="fields">The Fields</a></h2>

<p>The &quot;Filename&quot; field displays the name of the
currently loaded file. The name is displayed without any leading
pathname. If there is no currently loaded image (i.e., you're
looking at the default image, or a grabbed image) this field will
display &quot;&lt;none&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;Format&quot; field displays information describing
what image format the file is stored in, and how large the file
is (in bytes).</p>

<p>The &quot;Resolution&quot; field shows the width and height
(in image pixels) of the loaded image. Note that this does not
necessarily have anything to do with the size of the image
currently displayed on your screen. These numbers do not change
as you modify the display image.</p>

<p>The &quot;Cropping&quot; field displays the current state of
any cropping/selection activity. If you are looking at the entire
(uncropped) image, this field will show &quot;&lt;none&gt;&quot;.
If you are viewing a cropped portion of an image, this field will
display something like &quot;247x128 rectangle starting at
132,421&quot;. See &quot;<a href="image-window.html#cropping">Cropping</a>&quot;
for more details. </p>

<p>The &quot;Expansion&quot; field gives you information about
how the image is displayed. It can display something like
&quot;158.00% x 137.00% (505 x 273)&quot;. This tells you that
the current displayed image is 505 pixels wide and 273 pixels
high, and that it is 1.58 times wider and 1.37 times higher than
the original image (which, in this case, had a size of 320x200).</p>

<p>The &quot;Selection&quot; field displays the size and position
of the currently-drawn selection rectangle. If there isn't a
current selection, this field will show &quot;&lt;none&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;Colors&quot; field gives you detailed information on
how well (or poorly) color allocation went. If everything went
reasonably well it will display something like:</p>

<p>Got all 67 desired colors. (66 unique)</p>

<p>This means that 67 entries in the image's colormap were used
in the image, but that only 66 of these colors were different, as
far as the X server is concerned. (e.g., if 'white' (255,255,255)
was listed twice in the image's colormap, it would only allocate
one X colorcell, but would still count as 2 successful color
allocations).</p>

<p>See &quot;<a href="color-allocation.html">Color Allocation</a>&quot;
for a complete discussion of how colors are allocated, and what
the &quot;Colors&quot; field can tell you.</p>

<p>Note that the fields are filled in as information becomes
available. As such, they can be used as a rough 'progress
indicator' when loading images. When you begin loading, all the
fields are cleared. Once the image has been successfully loaded,
the top three fields (Filename, Format, Resolution) are filled
in. Once the colors have been allocated, and the display image
generated, the bottom four fields are shown (Cropping, Expansion,
Selection, and Colors).</p>

<h2><a name="status-lines">Status Lines</a></h2>

<p>The bottom two lines in the info window display various error
messages, warnings, and status information. These two lines are
also duplicated in the <i>xv controls</i> window.</p>

<p>The upper line is the more commonly used. It normally displays
a one-line summary of the current image and color allocation
success. If an error occurs, it will be displayed on this line as
well.</p>

<p>The lower line is used to display warning messages.</p>
