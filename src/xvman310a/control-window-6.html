<h2><a name="working-with-multiple-files">Working With Multiple
Files</a></h2>

<p><i>xv</i> provides a set of controls that let you conveniently
operate on a list of images. To use the following commands,
you'll have to start up <i>xv</i> with a list of filenames. For
example, you could type ' <tt>xv *.gif</tt> ' (assuming, of
course, that you have a bunch of files that end with the suffix
'.gif' in the current directory). </p>

<p>The filenames are listed in a scrollable window, as shown
below. The current selection is shown in reverse video. If there
are more names than will fit in the window, the scrollbar will be
enabled.</p>

<p><img src="images/fig-082.gif" width="434" height="186"> </p>

<h3><a name="operating-list-window">Operating a List Window</a></h3>

<p>The scrollbar operates as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>clicking in the top or bottom arrow of the scrollbar
        scrolls the list by one line in the appropriate
        direction. It will continue to scroll the list as long as
        you hold the mouse down.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The thumb (the small rectangle in the middle of the
        scrollbar) shows roughly where in the list you are. You
        can change your position in the list by clicking and
        dragging the thumb to another position in the scrollbar.
        The list will scroll around as you move the thumb.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>You can scroll the list up or down a page at a time by
        clicking in the grey region between the thumb and the top
        or bottom arrows.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>If you click on a name in the list, that name will become
        highlighted. You can drag the highlight bar up and down,
        and the list will scroll appropriately.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>It is also possible to control the list window from the
        keyboard. In all cases, you must make sure that the
        window sees the keypress. Generally, this means you have
        to have the cursor inside the window, though your window
        manager may also require you to click inside the window
        first.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The up and down arrow keys move the highlight bar up and
        down. If the bar is at the top or bottom of the window,
        the list will scroll one line.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The <b>&lt;PageUp&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;PageDown&gt;</b>
        keys scroll the list up or down a page at a time. These
        keys may be called <b>&lt;Previous&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;Next&gt;</b>
        on your keyboard. You can probably also page up and down
        by typing <b>&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Up&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Down&gt;</b>
        .</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Pressing the <b>&lt;Home&gt; </b>key will jump to the
        beginning of the list. Pressing the <b>&lt;End&gt;</b>
        key will jump to the bottom of the list. If you don't
        have <b>&lt;Home&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;End&gt;</b> keys on
        your keyboard, you may be able to emulate them by holding
        <b>&lt;Shift&gt;</b> and typing the <b>&lt;PageUp&gt;</b>
        and <b>&lt;PageDown&gt;</b> keys.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="file-commands">The File Commands</a></h3>

<p>You can directly view any image in the list by double-clicking
on its filename. If <i>xv</i> is unable to load the file (for any
of a variety of reasons), it'll display an appropriate error
message.</p>

<dl>
    <dt><a name="next"><img src="images/fig-083.gif" width="72"
        height="22"></a></dt>
    <dd>Attempts to load the next file in the list. If it is
        unable to load the next file, it will continue down the
        list until it successfully loads a file. If it gets to
        the bottom of the list without successfully loading a
        file, it will put up the default image.<br>
        Keyboard Equivalent: <b>&lt;Space&gt;</b></dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="prev"><b><img src="images/fig-084.gif"
        width="72" height="22"></b></a></dt>
    <dd>Attempts to load the previous file in the list. If it is
        unable to load the previous file, it will continue up the
        list until it successfully loads a file. If it gets to
        the top of the list without successfully loading a file,
        it will put up the default image.<br>
        Keyboard Equivalent: <b>&lt;backspace&gt;</b></dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="delete"><b><img src="images/fig-085.gif"
        width="72" height="22"></b></a></dt>
    <dd>This command lets you delete the currently selected file
        from the list (and optionally delete the associated disk
        file). Note that the currently selected file is the one
        with the highlight bar on it. While this is generally the
        same as the currently displayed image, it doesn't have to
        be.<br>
        Keyboard Equivalent: <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; d</b><p>The <b>Delete</b>
        command will pop up a window asking you what you want to
        delete. Your choices are:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>List Entry , which will remove the highlighted
                name from the list. (Keyboard Equivalent: <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>
                )</li>
            <li>Disk File , which will remove the highlighted
                name from the list and also delete the associated
                disk file. This removes unwanted images, just
                like manually typing ' <tt>rm &lt;filename&gt;</tt>
                ' in another window. (Keyboard Equivalent: <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt;
                d</b> )</li>
            <li>Cancel , which lets you get out of the <b>Delete</b>
                command without actually deleting anything.
                (Keyboard Equivalent: <b>&lt;Esc&gt;</b></li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="load"><b><img src="images/fig-086.gif"
        width="72" height="22"></b></a></dt>
    <dd>Opens the <i>xv load</i> window, which lets you load
        images that weren't specified on the original
        command-line. See &quot;<a href="load-window.html">The
        Load Window</a>&quot; for more details. Note: this
        function has been mostly taken over by the <i>visual
        schnauzer</i> (See &quot;<a
        href="visual-schnauzer-1.html">The Visual Schnauzer</a>&quot;
        ) but remains for largely historical reasons. (It <i>is</i>
        considerably faster than the <i>schnauzer</i>,
        however...)<br>
        Keyboard Equivalent: <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; l</b></dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="save"><b><img src="images/fig-087.gif"
        width="72" height="22"></b></a></dt>
    <dd>Opens the <i>xv save</i> window, which lets you save the
        current image (or current selected area) in a variety of
        image formats. See &quot;<a href="save-window-1.html">The
        Save Window</a>&quot; for more details.<br>
        Keyboard Equivalent: <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; s</b> </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="print"><img src="images/fig-088.gif" width="72"
        height="22"></a></dt>
    <dd>Prints the current image to a PostScript 2 device.. This
        command takes a somewhat Unix-centric approach to
        printing, but it may work on other operating systems.
        When you issue this command, it opens a dialog box which
        prompts you for the 'print' command to use. Normally,
        this is just ' <tt>lpr</tt> ', but if you'd like to send
        the output to another printer, you could use something
        like ' <tt>lpr -Pelsewhere</tt> '. (And right after you
        do that, you should change the name of that printer!) You
        change the default command the appears in this window by
        using the ' <tt>xv.print</tt> ' X resource. See &quot;<a
        href="modifying-behavior-4.html#resources">Other
        Resources</a>&quot; .<p>Anyway, enter some command that
        will have the desired effect. <i>xv</i> will open up the <i>xv
        postscript</i> window, where you can fine-tune the size,
        position, and rotation of your image. See &quot;<a
        href="postscript-window.html">The PostScript Window</a>&quot;
        for more information. When you press the <b>Ok</b>
        button, <i>xv</i> will generate the appropriate
        PostScript, and feed it as ' <tt>stdin</tt> ' to the
        command you entered earlier.<br>
        Keyboard Equivalent: <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt; p</b></p>
    </dd>

<h3><a name="reloading">Image Reloading</a></h3>

<p>It is occasionally desirable to reload an image file because
the contents of the file have changed. For example, you could be
downloading a file, and you might want to keep reloading the file
to check on the progress of the download. Or perhaps you have a
program that generates images, and you'd like to view these
images without any manual intervention.</p>

<p><i>xv</i> provides a way to reload an image via an external
signal. If you send the <i>xv</i> process a <tt>SIGQUIT</tt>
signal (' <tt>kill -QUIT &lt;pid&gt;</tt> ', or ' <tt>kill -3
&lt;pid&gt;</tt> ' on most systems), the program will reload the
currently selected file. (The one that is currently highlighted
in the <i>xv controls</i> window filename list.) This behavior is
exactly the same as hitting <b>&lt;Return&gt;</b> in the <i>xv
controls</i> window. If <i>xv</i> is currently in a state where
hitting <b>&lt;Return&gt;</b> in the controls window won't load
an image (i.e., some pop-up dialog box is grabbing all such
events), then sending this signal won't work either.</p>

<p>An idea: You could write a 'clock' program that, once a
minute, generates a really spiffy looking picture of the current
time (with color gradations, 3-d extruded numbers, whatever),
then sends <i>xv</i> the signal to reload the generated image. If
anyone ever does this, I'd like to hear about it.</p>

<p>Note: This will not work if the current file was read from <tt>&lt;stdin&gt;</tt>
.</p>

<p><i>xv</i> also has a 'polling mode', enabled by the '<tt>-poll</tt>'
option. When it is turned on, <i>xv</i> will attempt to recognize
when the currently displayed file changes on disk. (What with
UNIX being a multi-tasking OS, it's perfectly possible to have
another process modify a file while <i>xv</i> is displaying it.)
When the current file changes, <i>xv</i> will reload it.</p>

<p>You can use this feature to get <i>xv</i> to monitor all sorts
of things. For example, if you have one of those programs that
automatically goes out and <i>ftps</i> the latest version of the
US weather map, (and you do, in the <tt>unsupt</tt> directory),
then you can have <i>xv</i> automatically reload the map whenever
a new one is downloaded.</p>

<p>It probably goes without saying that 'PostScript' is a
registered trademark of Adobe Systems, Inc. </p>

<p>You could even use <i>xv</i> as a sort of frame buffer, to
allow otherwise non-X programs to display graphics. Just have
your program draw on its own internal 'frame buffer' (just an
appropriately sized hunk of memory), and periodically write it
out to a file in some <i>xv</i>-supported format. The PBM/PGM/PPM
formats are trivial to write. See the documentation in the <tt>doc</tt>
subdirectory of the <i>xv</i> distribution. Anyhow, periodically
write the image to a file, and have <i>xv</i> display the file
with the ' <tt>-poll</tt> ' option turned on. Voila! An instant
output-only frame buffer for X workstations, albeit a fairly slow
one.</p>
